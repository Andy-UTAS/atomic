Trapped ion systems are promising candidates for quantum computation and quantum sensing, and this system, developed by the MIT Lincoln Laboratory demonstrates an important step in the process of making quantum devices suitable for the real-world, namely, making them \"simpler\" and more robust. As part of this course, we will investigate how atomic physics allows us to understand, model, and construct simple, yet extraordinarily powerful quantum systems.

In contrast, this course begins where the quantum mechanics course left off: the conclusion for most introductory quantum courses is the full solution to the Schr\u00c3\u00b6dinger equation for the hydrogen atom, and poking at the structure of helium. We take these foundations, and construct a framework for understanding and predicting the structure of more complex systems, and importantly, the kind of systems would encounter in wild.

In this course we are going to study fundamental physical systems, which, on their surface can often appear simple, but are delightfully rich, engaging, and powerful. A testament to the foundational nature, utility, and continuing importance of the topics covered in this course is that during the period between 1995 - 2017, the fields of atomic and particle physics accounted for 25% of all Nobel prizes in science that were awarded. It is with this backdrop that we shall set out and seek to understand the fundamental properties and interactions of atoms and nuclei.</p> <p>Course summary</p> <p>This subject is designed to be a meaningful introduction to atomic physics. Hopefully your foray into the world of quantum mechanics was enjoyable, but it is almost inevidable that it left you with more questions than answers. Notably, most introductory quantum mechancis courses finish at the same spot: with the full-blown calculation of the energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom (in the nonrelativistic case). Whilst such a calculation is a triumph in its own right, the first question that you may ask is: \"does the hydrogen emission spectrum match my prediction\". The answer is no, and there are many distinct ways in which it does not match, due to different phenomena which arise from considering the atom in more detail. It is not the intention of this course the completely describe the hydrogen atom, on the contrary, we want to be able to describe all the atoms! This will mean developing theories and methods of calculation for multielectron systems, ensembles of atoms, and even touching on what happens with multiple nuclei. If your quantum mechanics course was a taster for what is out there in the quantum world; atomic physics narrows the focus of quantum mechanics to the measurement, manipulation, and evolution of atoms and their internal electronic transitions, our understanding of which provides our best tests of how the universe works, along with tests of how well we can predict how the universe works. The building blocks we shall study are basic atomic physics, angular momentum coupling, systems of indistinguishable particles, enesmbles of atoms, modern applications of atomic physics and molecular physics. It is worth noting that I am an experimental physicist by training, and it is my duty to ensure that experimental details permiate all that we study, because at the end of the day, we do need to actually make measurements to test our scientific theories: without this, one lives in a world of fiction.</p> <p>A rough outline of the course is as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Early atomic physics, the hydrogen atom, computational methods</li> <li>Hyperfine structure, angular momentum coupling</li> <li>Identical particles, transitions</li> <li>The density matrix</li> <li>Applications</li> <li>Molecular physics</li> </ol> <p>with approximately one week devoted to each topic, but with the natural ebb and flow ultimately dictating the timeline.</p>"},{"location":"particulars/#the-notes","title":"The notes","text":"<p>The notes on this site are designed to be consumed in concert the content from class, with certain aspects highlighted differently in the different media; in extreme cases, different paths are used to arrive at the same destination.

The first is what happens when when measures a ground-state energy: when you do spectroscopy, you put in a photon with enough energy to drive the transition. By definition, the ground-state energy is the same as the ionisation energy of the atom, so you will generate muons in the spectroscopy process, which has the disadvantage of destroying your hard-won muonic hydrogen, but also means that you now have charge available to perturb the energy levels of surrounding atoms. There is also the practical consideration of when we perform spectroscopy, we like microwaves and optical frequencies, as we can control the frequencies of both of these very well. In muonic hydrogen, the energies involved are much larger than those of hydrogen - see the energy-level diagram below - and producing monochromatic radiation at those wavelengths is hard! Explicitly, experiments which deal even with the \\(1s\\rightarrow2p\\) states in hydrogen are hard work, as you require a laser in the UV, and these are both hard to make and difficult to use.
