[^1]: more accurately, at this time it was the Bohr-Sommerfeld model, which is an extension of the Bohr model to include elliptical orbits which fixed some problems. One will also see in [solid-state physics](https://ssp.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/) that Sommerfeld has a real talent for tweaking existing theories to make them run a bit better.
[^2]: A study of the the relativistic wave equation, known as the _Dirac equation_, is required to fully flesh out this result.
[^3]: In this case we can, but more generally, the magnetic moment of the nucleus cannot be ignored (see LINK ME! hyperfine splitting)
