    Given this, along with
    
$$
\cos \theta Y_{l m}(\theta, \phi)=\left(\frac{l^2-m^2}{4 l^2-1}\right)^{1 / 2} Y_{l-1, m}(\theta, \phi)+\left[\frac{(l+1)^2-m^2}{4(l+1)^2-1}\right]^{1 / 2} Y_{l+1, m}(\theta, \phi),
$$

and

$$
\int d \Omega Y_{l^{\prime} m^{\prime}}^*(\theta, \phi) Y_{l m}(\theta, \phi)=\delta_{l^{\prime} l} \delta_{m^{\prime} m}
$$

gives us

$$
\left\langle l^{\prime}, m^{\prime}|\cos \theta| l, m\right\rangle=\delta_{m^{\prime} m}\left\{\left(\frac{l^2-m^2}{4 l^2-1}\right)^{1 / 2} \delta_{l^{\prime}, l-1}+\left[\frac{(l+1)^2-m^2}{4(l+1)^2-1}\right]^{1 / 2} \delta_{l^{\prime}, l+1}\right\} .

## Exercises

### Preliminary provocations
1. What happens if you happen to choose your variational wavefunction perfectly? That is, you trail wavefunction is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian?

$$
E_0 \le \langle \psi | \mathscr{H} | \psi \rangle = E_0 \langle \psi | \psi \rangle = E_0
$$
as you might expect

[^1]: more accurately, at this time it was the Bohr-Sommerfeld model, which is an extension of the Bohr model to include elliptical orbits which fixed some problems. One will also see in [solid-state physics](https://ssp.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/) that Sommerfeld has a real talent for tweaking existing theories to make them run a bit better.
[^2]: A study of the the relativistic wave equation, known as the _Dirac equation_, is required to fully flesh out this result.
[^3]: In this case we can, but more generally, the magnetic moment of the nucleus cannot be ignored (see LINK ME! hyperfine splitting)
