# Additional resources

This page is the space for additional resources which may prove to be of some use and/or interest for curious individuals.

!!! info "Websites"
    - Besides being a best-in-class mathematics educator, Grant Sanderson, a.k.a. [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/), has an [excellent video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) on the essence of linear algebra, which works to give you firm geometric grounding and build intuition in an area which is often taught in a highly abstract way, far removed from its practical application and implications. Given the heavy lifting that is done by linear algebra in atomic physics - and physics more generally - a quick brush-up on the subject, which is taught in such an insightful and refreshing manner, is well worth your time.

!!! info "Texts"
    - Undergraduate texts for quantum mechanics are common; however, concise, informed, relevant, and entertaining texts are much less common. I think the texts prescribed for both quantum and atomic physics are the best texts for the courses, but other texts which are recommended include
        - The classic - and increasingly difficult to find - Physics of Atoms and Molecules by B H Bransden and Charles J. Joachain
        - [A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics, Second Edition](https://uscibooks.aip.org/books/a-modern-approach-to-quantum-mechanics-second-edition/) by John S. Townsend from [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/)
        - [Introduction to Quantum Mechanics](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/introduction-to-quantum-mechanics/990799CA07A83FC5312402AF6860311E#overview) by David J. Griffiths and Darrell F. Schroeter from [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu/)
        - [Quantum Mechanics](https://atomoptics-nas.uoregon.edu/~dsteck/teaching/quantum-mechanics/quantum-mechanics-notes.pdf) by Daniel A. Steck from the [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/)
        - [Harry Potter and the methods of rationality](http://www.hpmor.com/) by [Eliezer Eudkowsky](https://www.yudkowsky.net/). Who know that Harry Potter fan fiction could provide such insight. As a jumping off point: _Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit._

!!! info "Previous course notes"

    Atomic physics at UTAS is taught every second (even-numbered) year, with the previous course outing having been taught by [Krzysztof Bolejko](https://discover.utas.edu.au/Krzysztof.Bolejko) and [Ross Turner](https://discover.utas.edu.au/Ross.Turner) for atomic physics and nuclear physics respectively. The notes from the 2022 course are posted here as a reference, but it should be emphasised that the course structure is vastly different, and consequently one's mileage may vary.

    !!! example "Atomic physics"
