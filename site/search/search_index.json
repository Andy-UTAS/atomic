Here we adopt a more general representation of quantum states, which is not limited to the degrees of freedom chosen to represent the wavefunction (e.g. position/momentum space) but rather talk about a state as an object containing all of the information that we can know about the system.

In order to describe this phenomenon, we consider the complex-valued electric fields from both sources, and ultimately calculate the intensity as the square of the field amplitude, and the nature of complex-valued fields permits interference effects.
